# Emoji Prediction using LSTM and GloVe Embeddings

This project aims to predict the emoji associated with a given sentence using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks and pre-trained GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) word embeddings.

## Project Overview

The model is trained on a dataset containing sentences with associated emojis. The sentences are tokenized and converted into word embeddings using pre-trained GloVe word vectors. The LSTM model is then trained on the input sentences to predict the associated emoji. The model is evaluated on a test dataset to measure its performance.
